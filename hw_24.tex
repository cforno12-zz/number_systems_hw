\textbf{Project 10.20}: Prove the analogous statement for decreasing bounded
sequences. In summary, we then know that every monotonic bounded sequence
converges. \\
\indent
\textbf{Proof}: We will prove that every decreasing bounded sequence converges.
Suppose $(x_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ is a sequence that is decreasing and bounded and
let A be a set. Then the set $A =
\{x_k:k \in \mathbb{N}\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded. Thus, by Proposition
8.50, it has a greatest lower bound $s$. We will show that $\lim_{k\to\infty}x_k
= s$.\\
\indent
Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Then $s+\varepsilon > s$, and so $s+\varepsilon$ is not a
lower bound for A. Thus, there exists some $M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_M < s
+ \varepsilon$. Since the sequence is decreasing, we have $x_m \leq x_M$ for all
$m \geq M$. Therefore, for $m \geq M$, we have $s - \varepsilon < s \leq x_m
\leq x_M < s + \varepsilon$, and so $|x_m-s|<\varepsilon$ by Proposition 10.8 (v).$\Box$
